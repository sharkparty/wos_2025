# Bottom Line Up Front

This challenge was a genuine pleasure to work on ‚Äî it struck that sweet spot between open-ended creativity and thoughtful constraint. It also gave me my first real hands-on exposure to Radix, which was both exciting and instructive. I enjoyed experimenting with its composability and seeing how it enforces consistency across components in an enterprise context.

The following notes summarize my assumptions, process, and reflections throughout the exercise. I tend to document my reasoning as I go, both to make my thinking visible and to highlight where I‚Äôd normally seek alignment with teammates or design. It‚Äôs the same collaborative pattern I bring to production work: a mix of curiosity, rigor, and proactive communication.

I had a lot of fun tinkering with this one ‚Äî thank you for the thoughtful prompt and the opportunity to build something that felt grounded in real-world tradeoffs.

# Outline

1. **Open Questions & Assumptions**
   1. This section captures the real-time reasoning I applied during the take-home challenge. It outlines the open questions I identified, the assumptions I made to move forward, and how I balanced collaboration-minded decisions with independent execution. Themes include product gaps (e.g., missing role designs), accessibility and pagination concerns, UX tradeoffs, API and schema integrity, and minor UI bugs. I also note where I would typically partner with design or backend to clarify requirements and prevent downstream rework. 
   1. Core takeaway: I prioritize transparency, thoughtful defaults, and forward-compatible design even when working autonomously.
2. **Suggestions** 
   1. Constructive feedback on both the challenge process and developer experience. I propose enabling private forking, improving backend validation, tightening installation steps, and enhancing documentation and component discoverability in Radix. I also emphasize the value of close designer‚Äìdeveloper collaboration to reduce friction and reinforce shared intent. 
   1. Core takeaway: My instinct is to improve systems holistically ‚Äî not just the code, but the processes and tools that shape how teams collaborate.
3. **Frameworks & Libraries Used** 
   1. A technical rationale for each tool chosen, balancing pragmatism with long-term maintainability. This includes React, Next.js, SWR, Jest, Storybook, ESLint, Prettier, and minor supporting libraries. I explain how these tools reinforce consistent quality, enable scalable development, and promote CI/CD alignment. 
   1. Core takeaway: My technical decisions are grounded in community standards, developer experience, and operational maturity ‚Äî always with an eye toward scalability and collaboration.

## Frameworks & Libraries Used

### 1. Core Frameworks

* **React**
  Selected as it aligns with the interview panel‚Äôs preferred framework. React remains highly performant, well-documented, and broadly supported within the engineering community. Its ubiquity ensures ease of hiring, maintainability, and long-term ecosystem stability.
* **Next.js**
  Chosen over CRA (which is effectively deprecated) for its mature feature set‚Äîserver-side rendering, static site generation, and integrated API routes. Next.js balances flexibility, scalability, and community adoption while supporting modern development standards and deployment workflows.
* **SWR**
  A lightweight, declarative data-fetching library leveraging caching, revalidation, and focus-based updates. SWR reduces boilerplate, simplifies state management, and improves perceived performance via *stale-while-revalidate* patterns.


---

### 2. Testing & Quality Assurance

* **Jest**
  Used for both unit and integration testing to ensure stability and prevent regressions. Reliable test coverage is key to maintaining quality and developer confidence throughout iterative releases.
* **ESLint**
  Enforces code quality, accessibility, and performance best practices. Rulesets are aligned with shared conventions to minimize cognitive load and code review friction.
* **Prettier**
  Standardizes code formatting across the codebase, improving readability and reducing stylistic debates during review.

---

### 3. UI Development & Design Alignment

* **Storybook**
  Employed for isolated component development, visual documentation, and design review. This approach enables asynchronous collaboration with design and QA by showcasing UI states that may not yet exist or be easily reproduced within the production app. Storybook effectively bridges design intent and implementation reality‚Äîparticularly valuable in a waterfall or staggered delivery context.
* **react-loading-skeleton**
  Added as a pragmatic placeholder solution under time constraints. In a full implementation, I would refine this to use a more integrated skeleton loading pattern consistent with the design system.

### 4. Integration & Engineering Philosophy

* **Integration Philosophy:**
  Each framework was selected for its compatibility with modular, incremental delivery and ease of integration into a CI/CD pipeline.
* **Code Hygiene:**
  ESLint and Prettier operate as pre-commit hooks to enforce consistency and quality from the first line of code.
* **Testing Discipline:**
  Jest coverage thresholds are defined and enforced. Every UI component includes at least snapshot or behavioral test coverage to protect against visual or functional regressions.
* **Documentation Alignment:**
  Storybook doubles as both a development and design reference point. It should remain continuously synchronized with production components to maintain a single source of truth for visual and interaction patterns.
* **Version Management:**
  Frameworks are maintained at current minor or patch versions to ensure security, compatibility, and performance without introducing unnecessary churn or breaking changes.

## Suggestions as an interviewee

### 1. Application & Repository Setup

* **Private Forking Option:**
  Consider enabling private forking for candidates who wish to apply discreetly. üëÄ This would make it easier for professionals exploring opportunities confidentially to complete the challenge without broadcasting activity publicly.
* **Server Installation Command:**
  The `README` currently recommends using `npm install`. To align with the ‚Äú**Do not alter the backend API**‚Äù requirement and avoid potential dependency drift, this should be updated to `npm ci`.
    * *Actionable Follow-Up:* I would submit a **local-only** PR for this adjustment, but I've already bent the rules, so I'll leave this for now

---

### 2. Backend & Validation

* **Schema Enforcement:**
  The backend should include schema validation‚Äîideally implemented through **AJV** or **Zod**. AJV has the added advantage of native **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)** support. This would ensure stronger contract integrity between frontend and backend, improving developer confidence and reducing integration friction.

---

### 3. Design & Collaboration Practices

* **Designer Collaboration:**
  My general preference is to develop an ongoing partnership with the designer to understand their intent and reduce costly design drift.
  A strong designer‚Äìengineer relationship fosters alignment, respect, and mutual trust‚Äîensuring that neither domain makes decisions counter to shared product goals.
  Many of the open questions noted earlier would naturally be resolved through this kind of collaboration. Of course, I recognize that a take-home challenge limits such interaction‚Äîever onward!

---

### 4. Documentation & Developer Experience

* **Radix Docs Copy Enhancement:**
  It would be helpful if all prop definitions within the Radix documentation could be copied via an `onClick` interaction, streamlining component usage and prototyping.
* **Component Primitives:**
  Building and publishing core primitives (e.g., `Button`, `Table`) along with shared utilities for shadows, rounding, and spacing would improve design consistency and developer efficiency across the codebase.
* **Radix Icon Searchability:**
  The Radix Icons documentation could benefit from improved search capabilities. For example, the ‚ÄúDots‚Äù icon is actually `DotsHorizontalIcon`‚Äîa small detail that slows down component discovery during implementation.

## Open Questions & Assumptions

### 1. Product & Design Clarifications

* **Roles Tab:**
  The prompt references adding functionality to update both users and roles, but the ‚ÄúRoles‚Äù section is not designed. I inferred its design by extrapolating from the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù tab for visual and interaction consistency.
* **Bulk Actions:**
  No group or aggregate actions are depicted in the UI. In an enterprise environment, this may limit efficiency for bulk updates of users.
* **Pagination:**
  Pagination is present but lacks indexed selection, which would create excessive scrolling in large datasets. I would typically use cursor-based pagination on the server and allow for adjustable page sizes. Current pagination controls also need accessibility and mobile optimizations.
* **Sorting & Filtering:**
  Sorting and filtering functionality is expected but not defined. These are critical for scalability and usability in large datasets.
* **Sticky Header:**
  A sticky table header would improve usability and data context retention during scrolling.
* **Delete Action Treatment:**
  The dropdown‚Äôs ‚ÄúDelete User‚Äù action could be visually distinguished (e.g., red styling). However, this introduces red-green colorblind accessibility concerns. I‚Äôd collaborate with design to align with WorkOS‚Äôs accessibility philosophy.
* **I'm definitely not a designer:**
  I'm always happy to bias toward action and deliver things, but I also hold that in tension with my deep respect for design. My best friend is the Director of Design at a SaaS company, so I'm biased.

### 2. Responsiveness, Accessibility & Internationalization

* **Internationalization (i18n):**
  Not specified, so I assumed English-only for this exercise.
* **Responsive Design:**
  Mobile and tablet viewports were not explicitly required. I assumed desktop-first priorities but noted where responsive design considerations would arise.
* **Focus & Animation:**
  The provided `focus-visible` state was visually aggressive; I refined it to be more subtle but would like to align with design.
  Animation thresholds were not specified. Given an enterprise context, I minimized nonessential motion to emphasize clarity and performance while preserving polish where it enhances the overall UX.

---

### 3. Technical Architecture & Implementation

* **Authentication:**
  Authentication is not implemented, and the brief specifies an immutable server, resulting in an insecure setup. In production, I‚Äôd confirm authentication flows and data protection expectations early.
* **Schema Validation:**
  The API lacks schema validation. I added UI-side validation to protect integrity. Ideally, the API would enforce schema consistency, with alignment via database tooling and observability (o11y) hooks to detect violations and prevent brittle coupling between frontend and backend.
* **State Management:**
  The provided user state pattern is functional for the assignment‚Äôs scale but not sufficient for enterprise-grade complexity. In a full implementation, I‚Äôd introduce more scalable state tooling to support more robust error handling (e.g. user feedback regarding latency, server outages, etc), o11y, concurrency, optimistic updates, and caching strategies.
* **Pending States & DOM Stability:**
  Some pending or loading states could be refined to minimize DOM ‚Äújumping‚Äù during updates and better handling of error states.
* **Autofocus Behavior:**
  The autofocus on the search filter steals focus from the primary input field, which slightly harms UX.
* **Did you make it this far?!?!:** Holy cow. I'm so honored you've given me so much time to share my thoughts with you. If you'd like more technical notes they're added as `TODOs` in the code. Mention you made it here and I will genuinely be staggered.

### 4. Component Libraries & Design Systems

* **Radix Usage:**
  The app already integrates Radix as a design system dependency. Were that not the case, I would have considered abstracting the component layer into a separate library.
  Installing the full Radix library is somewhat heavy-handed, but I chose it anticipating broader adoption across the app.
  A secondary motivation‚Äîadmittedly non-functional‚Äîwas my interest in deepening familiarity with Radix in a production-like context.
* **Form Controls:**
  I encountered challenges integrating certain Radix form controls within the allotted time and documented these for follow-up.
* **Fonts:**
  The Figma file contained an untitled font-face. I substituted a close generic to maintain visual fidelity while respecting proprietary font licenses.

---

### 5. Tooling & Process

* **Linting & Pre-Commit Hooks:**
  I omitted local linting hooks in favor of CI-based linting and auto-fixing. This reduces local developer friction and centralizes consistency enforcement across contributors.
* **Version Control Demonstration:**
  I intentionally introduced a controlled merge conflict (two different Roboto font selections) within a PR to demonstrate git fluency and open a discussion about WorkOS‚Äôs internal merge vs. rebase practices.
  [Reference Commit](https://github.com/sharkparty/wos_2025/pull/3/commits/07034902cb8dcfda04e759353f14c37dbe9b12bf)
* **Button Visibility:**
  I disabled (rather than removed) the ‚ÄúAdd User‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdd Role‚Äù buttons since they are not wired up. This preserves visual expectations without implying a missing feature.

---

### 6. Known Bugs & Improvements

* **Dropdown Focus Bug:**
  The dropdown‚Äôs `onClick` handler disables focus on its child trigger button. This could be resolved via ref-passing. I prioritized higher-value tasks within the time constraints, noting this as a minor UI issue for later refinement.
